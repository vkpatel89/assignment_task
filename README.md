// design strategy
1. After analysing the complexity of design, found that I should use custom css and js only for the UI as of now because seems we will not be able to fully utilize a css framework capability for this kind of complex design.
2. Created required folder structure
3. Splitted css files and used reset and utilize and also used color variables.
4. Since mobile design was not avalaible, making it a mobile first approach was a tough task, but still made this page fully responsive for smaller and medium size devices as well
5. Have hosted the page on github pages and the Website link is : https://vkpatel89.github.io/assignment_task/
